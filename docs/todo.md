# TODO

Project work queue.

- `/todo <text>` captures a new item with a generated slug.
- `/todo` (no arguments) lists pending slugs.
- `/implement <slug>` plans and implements a pending item.
- `/implement` (no arguments) lists pending items and asks
  which to act on.

Each implemented item gets a planning doc at
`docs/issues/<slug>.md` that captures the problem statement,
plan, decisions, and outcome.

## Pending

<!-- Items captured by /todo land here. -->

## Done

<!-- Completed items are moved here by /implement during
     finalisation, linked to their issue doc. -->
